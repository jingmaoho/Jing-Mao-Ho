### Bio

#### I am a PhD candidate in the Sociology Department at Cornell University. I hold an MS in Computer Science and an MA in Sociology from National Taiwan University. 

My research interests include political sociology, science, technology, & knowledge, comparative sociology, historical sociology, computational social science, and sociological theory. I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to analyze archival, organizational, survey, or textual data. 

My dissertation explores the relationship between statistics, societies, and politics. In addition, I have been involved in research projects on a variety of topics, such as trust, democractic politics, world society, social networks, and elites.
