## Who am I?

I'm a Bourdieusian data scientist. I approach data science & data analysis from both sociological and computational perspectives. In addition to applying statistical models to analyze data on social dynamics, I also do research on the reflexivity of data and society.

My Sociology dissertation explores the relationship between statistics, societies, and politics. I also have been involved in research projects on a variety of substantive topics, such as crime, deviance, and social control, trust, mobilizations, democratic politics, world society, social networks, organizations, and elites.

I also hold an MS in Computer Science and BS in Information Egineering. My computer science interests are in machine learning, algorithm analysis, and theoretical computer science. I'm particularly interested in the mathematical and philosophical fundamentals of predictive modeling. 

## What's on my GitHub?

### Statistical and Computational Models
While I apply a variety of quantitative approaches to my social science research, I'd like to share my notes pertaining to statistics, data science, machine learning, and theoretical computer science here. It's my philosophy that the deeper you understand the methods you use, the better researcher you will become. Also, it is always fun for me to dig into those commonly used models!

### Data Analysis
In addition to the mathematics of data science, I'm also passionate about data wrangling and statistical analysis.
