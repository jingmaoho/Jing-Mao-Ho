### Bio

I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at Cornell University. I hold an MS in Computer Science and an MA in Sociology from National Taiwan University, and a BS in Information Engineering from I-Shou University.

My social science research interests include computational social science, data science, statistical methodology, political sociology, science, technology, & knowledge, and social theory. I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to analyze archival, organizational, survey, and textual data. My Sociology dissertation explores the relationship between statistics, societies, and politics. In addition, I have been involved in research projects on a variety of substantive topics, such as trust, democractic politics, world society, social networks, and elites.

My computer science interests are in machine learning, algorithm analysis, and theoretical computer science. In addition to applying computational and statistical models to slove real-world problems, I'm particulary interested in the mathematical and philosophical fundamentals of predictive models.

### What's on my GitHub?

I'd like to share my thoughs and writings pertaining to theoretical computer science, data science, machine learning, and statistics here. Below you can find some of my notes on the mathematics behind computational models and their implementations in R or Python:
