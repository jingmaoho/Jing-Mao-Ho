## Who am I?

I'm a Bourdieusian data scientist. I approach data science & data analysis from both sociological and computational perspectives. I'm currently a PhD candidate in Sociology at Cornell University. I hold an MS in Computer Science and an MA in Sociology from National Taiwan University, and a BS in Information Engineering from I-Shou University.

My social science research interests include computational social science, data science, statistical methodology, political sociology, science, technology, & knowledge, public opinion, culture, diffusion, and social theory. I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to analyze archival, organizational, survey, and textual data. My Sociology dissertation explores the relationship between statistics, societies, and politics. In addition, I have been involved in research projects on a variety of substantive topics, such as trust, democratic politics, world society, social networks, and elites.

My computer science interests are in machine learning, algorithm analysis, and theoretical computer science. In addition to applying computational and statistical models to solve real-world problems, I'm particularly interested in the mathematical and philosophical fundamentals of predictive models.

## What's on my GitHub?

### Statistical and Computational Models
While I apply a variety of quantitative approaches to my social science research, I'd like to share my notes pertaining to statistics, data science, machine learning, and theoretical computer science here. It's my philosophy that the deeper you understand the methods you use, the better researcher you will become. Also, it is always fun for me to dig into those commonly used models! Below you can find some of the documents I've written on the mathematics underlying certain statistical/ML/computational models and their implementations in R or Python:

[Linear Classifier: Support Vector Machines (SVM)](https://jingmaoho.github.io/SVM.pdf)

[Linear Regression: Least Squares Estimation (LSE)] (coming soon!)

[Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM)] (coming soon!)


### Data Visualization
In addition to the mathematics of data science, I'm also passionate about visualizing data.
